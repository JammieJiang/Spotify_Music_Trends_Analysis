# ðŸŽµ Spotify Music Trends Analysis

An interactive web application built with Streamlit that explores music trends and patterns from Spotify's popular songs dataset (2010-2019). This project provides data-driven insights into how music characteristics have evolved over time through beautiful visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Features

### Interactive Data Exploration
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter data by year range and music genres in real-time
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes

### Key Analyses
1. **Danceability vs Energy Correlation**
   - Scatter plot with trend line analysis
   - Statistical correlation coefficients
   - Year-over-year trend visualization

2. **Genre Analysis**
   - Genre popularity evolution over time (stacked bar chart)
   - Song duration distribution by genre (box plot)
   - Popularity ratings comparison (violin plot)
   - Genre ranking statistics

3. **Data Insights**
   - Real-time metrics and statistics
   - Interactive hover details
   - Downloadable filtered datasets

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py          # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ top10_s.csv                # Dataset (required)
â”œâ”€â”€ img.png / img.jpg          # Background image (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ fonts.googleapis.com.css   # Custom fonts (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies

â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Git ignore file
```

## Dataset Format

The application expects a CSV file (`top10_s.csv`) with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `year` | Release year |
| `title` | Song title |
| `artist` | Artist name |
| `top genre` | Music genre |
| `dur` | Duration in milliseconds |
| `dnce` | Danceability (0-100) |
| `nrgy` | Energy level (0-100) |
| `pop` | Popularity score (0-100) |
| `val` | Valence (0-100) |
| `acous` | Acousticness (0-100) |
| `spch` | Speechiness (0-100) |
| `live` | Liveness (0-100) |
| `dB` | Loudness in dB |

## Customization

### Background Image
Place an image file named `img.png` or `img.jpg` in the project root to use as a custom background.

### Colors and Styling
The application uses a purple gradient theme. You can modify colors in the CSS section of `streamlit_app.py`:
- Main gradient: `#667eea` to `#764ba2`
- Accent colors defined in the style section

## Key Insights

The application helps answer questions such as:
- How has the relationship between danceability and energy evolved over time?
- Which genres have gained or lost popularity over the years?
- How do song durations vary across different genres?
- What are the popularity trends for different music genres?
